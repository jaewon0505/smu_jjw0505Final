While taking classes in various majors this semester, I realized once again that this path was not suitable for me at all. Really, this road is not for me. It wasn't the worst, but it was bad. I was really envious of the other students who wanted to go down this path and took the design class with passion and interest. They would think that this time would help them develop and move forward, but I never felt that way. ooh i want to graduate
