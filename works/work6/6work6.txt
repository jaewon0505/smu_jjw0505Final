School life is quite satisfactory. There were no accidents, but they all passed. I made new friends and a relationship that developed a little deeper. Conversely, distant relationships have also developed. I think this is my school life. I always try to have only good relationships, but it doesn't work out the way I want. However, if you think that this process will serve as a fertilizer for building a better relationship next time, even this will come back to you as a source of strength for you. I want to tell everyone that it is not too bad to leave your body as it flows and not be too tied up in your school life.
