I feel like I learned a lot while taking this class, but I don't feel like I learned anything.
I feel like I'm interest in the new field of coding, and the results of learning this class are the results I've never made before, and they were cool. That's it. Codes that are too difficult, 
coding words that I don't understand at all, and the system of coding. I shouldn't have tried to understand you.
